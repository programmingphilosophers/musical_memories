### Technologies used
* Bootstrap: Adam created a carousel prototype with bootstrap to scroll through images and related text table. This was modified to fit existing site look.
* Sinatra MVC: Similar to shopping list app.
*
### Project Approach

* We brainstormed ideas and quick rough wireframes. We simulated user stories using Google Music artist albmum lookup to see what experience we wanted to create and repeated this with a friend. Read and see our user stories, ERD's and  wireframes [here.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZhfC3Cqa7CvaiTzcQUD2xVrAqudT6L4q1gGsjzXPHWE/edit#slide=id.g74d139cf2_0_34)
* We agreed on features and technologies.
* We split up tasks. We both had our working sinatra list apps with authentication to use as a foundation.
